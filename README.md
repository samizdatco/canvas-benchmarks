# Node.js Canvas Benchmarks

This repo contains a set of sample scripts to run against a variety of Node.js Canvas libraries. The [`tests`](/tests) directory contains the individual tests and the [`config.js`](/src/config.js) file sets runtime parameters for testing and shims to harmonize calling conventions between libraries.

A new set of benchmarks can be generated by running:

```shell
npm install
npm test
```
Running the benchmarks will create a subdirectory of `results` containing:
- [`index.md`][results]: the results formatted with links to each testâ€™s source code and the images generated by the different libraries
- [`data.json`][data]: the config details of the run and the individual timings for each benchmark
- [`snapshots/`][snapshots]: sample output from each library for each benchmark
