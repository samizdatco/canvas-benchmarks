# Node.js Canvas Benchmarks

This repo contains a set of sample scripts to run against a variety of Node.js Canvas libraries. The `tests` directory contains the individual tests and the `config.js` file sets runtime parameters for testing and shims to harmonize calling conventions between libraries.

A new set of benchmarks can be generated by running:

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

Running the benchmarks will update several files:
- [`results.md`](/results.md) presents the results formatted with links to each testâ€™s source code and the images generated by the different libraries
- [`results.json`](/results.json) contains the config details of the run and the individual timings for each benchmark
- `img/snapshots` contains sample output of each benchmark
- `img/bars` contains SVGs used for the bar graphs in the markdown doc
