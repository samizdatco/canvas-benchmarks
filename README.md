# Node.js Canvas Benchmarks

This repo contains a set of sample scripts to run against a variety of Node.js Canvas libraries. The `tests` directory contains the individual tests and the `config.js` file sets runtime parameters for testing and shims to harmonize calling conventions between libraries.

A new set of benchmarks can be generated by running:

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

Running the benchmarks will create a subdirectory of `results` containing:
- [`index.md`][results] presents the results formatted with links to each testâ€™s source code and the images generated by the different libraries
- [`data.json`][data] contains the config details of the run and the individual timings for each benchmark
- [`snapshots/`][snapshots] contains sample output of each benchmark
- [`bars/`][bars] contains SVGs used for the bar graphs in the markdown doc
